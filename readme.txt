== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**Is 2ConnnectMe service FREE?**
Those free-tier-account services with a default chat room "GENERAL" is provided for FREE for unlimited Agents, unlimited websites for lifetime. More than enough functions for a StartUp or personal usage.

We also have [flexible pricing plan](https://www.2connectme.com/index.php/pricing/). 

When your business grows and requires multiple chat rooms, e.g. for distributing the customer chats to Agents from different departments, we have limited budget pricing plan for growing business.

For large enterprise with high traffic call center operation and advance call distribution, we have affordable pricing plan.

**Could I try the service before registration?**
We have agent and website built for self-run demonstration. Please go to our 2ConnectMe [self-run demo website](https://www.2connectme.com/index.php/demonstration/).

**Why I cannot hear ring tone for incoming calls**
Ring Tone is supported in desktop browsers and mobile app. Ring tone is configured to "Off" by default. This can be modified in settings of 2ConnectMe, i.e. menu -> Account -> Profile -> Ring Tone. The other reason may be the security settings of browser not allowing 2connectme.com to play sound. Please refer to [FAQ->Operation & Usage -> Ring Tone](https://2connectme.com/index.php/support-faq/#faqOperations) for detail settings required.

**Why floating chat icon is not shown on mobile devices?**
Refer to General settings of this plugin. Set "Disable at Small Screen" width to 1 px width. The default value is 767 px width. Set the value to 1 px width which means floating icon is shown on all devices regardless of screen width.

**I want use my own icon. Can I change it?**
From version 1.1 onwards, pre-defined icons for Chat, Phone, Video and Mail with different pre-defined sizes, Large (50x50), Medium (40x40) and Small (30x30) are provided. Reminders: If you need DIRECT Phone or Video call PopUp Form WITHOUT Contact Form, you have to select either Phone or Video icon. Otherwise, strange behaviour will happen. In other words, if you need Phone or Video buttons on Contact Form, you should still select either Chat or Mail icon because the PopUp is the Contact Form.

**I want contact form pop up when website visitor hover the icon instead of click the icon. Any configuration for this?**
Refer to General settings of this plugin. Set the "Change on Event" to "hover".

**Where can I configure the size of device to be determined as small devices so that this plugin is not shown?**
Refer to General settings of this plugin. Set "Disable at Small Screen" width to 1 px width. The default value is 767 px width. Set the value to 1 px width which means floating icon is shown on all devices regardless of screen width.

**Where can I configure bottom right or button left of the chat icon on screen?**
Refer to "Chat" settings of this plugin. Set "Horizontal Position" to "left" or "right".

** Can I change the width of Contact Form?**
It is automatically adjusted from ver 1.1 onwards. No width configuration is needed.

** Can I customize the contact Form such as header texts, adding my company name and hide the fields and action buttons (Chat, Phone, Video, Mail)?
Yes. It is new features provided in ver 1.1 [ Refer to here for details.](https://www.2connectme.com/index.php/documentation/chat-room-customizations/#articleTOC_0)

** What further settings are needed for Mobile "Business Chat Room - 2ConnectMe" **
No further configuration needed. Mobile one shares the same user accounts information. Just use the same user account to logon through mobile. 

**I do not receive customer chat in mobile App, what should I do?**
In order to ensure Mobile App is able to receive visitor enquiries, security settings "Allow Notification" and "Allow Auto-Start" must be enabled in Android phone. Since Android manufacturers make their own version of Android with different customisation, it is not possible to conduct test on each of them. If you are not able to receive customer chat, please contact us for support. We are happy here to solve any issues for you.

** Can I use the same account to logon PC browsers and Mobile App of 2ConnectMe? **
Yes. They can handle customer chat at the same time.

** Where can I find more FAQ about Wordpress Plugin and Mobile App?**
